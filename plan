What Is Rock Paper Scissors?
You may have played rock paper scissors before. Maybe you’ve used 
it to decide who pays for dinner or who gets first choice of players for a team.

If you don't know , rock paper scissors is a hand game for two  players
Participants say “rock, paper, scissors” and then simultaneously form their hands into the shape of a rock 
(a fist), a piece of paper (palm facing downward), or a pair of scissors (two fingers extended). 
The rules are straightforward:

Rock smashes scissors.
Paper covers rock.
Scissors cut paper.
Now that you have the rules down, you can start thinking about how they might translate to Python code.

Play a Single Game of Rock Paper Scissors in Python
Using the description and rules above, you can make a game of rock paper scissors.
 Before you dive in, you’re going to need to import the module you’ll use to simulate the computer’s choices:

import random
Awesome! Now you’re able to use the different tools inside random to randomize the computer’s actions in the game. 
Now what. Since your users will also need to be able to choose their actions, 
the first logical thing you need is a way to take in user input.

Take User Input
Taking input from a user is pretty straightforward in Python. 
The goal here is to ask the user what they would like to choose as 
an action and then assign that choice to a variable:

user_action = input("Enter a their pick (rock, paper, scissors): ")
This will prompt the user to enter a selection and save it to a variable.
 Now that the user has selected an action, the computer needs to decide what to do.

Make the Computer Choose
A competitive game of rock paper scissors involves strategy. 
Rather than trying to develop a model for that, though, 
you can save yourself some time by having the computer select a random action. 
Random selections are a great way to have the computer choose a pseudorandom value.

You can use random.choice() to have the computer randomly select between the actions:

Determine a Winner
Now that both players have made their choice, you just need a way to decide who wins. 



       # import random module  

      .1  step one would be to add plr1 and plr 2 (as parameters)
            check the parameters and see if there is and error.
            also while doing so compare them to see who wins .
      
      # Print multiline instruction 
      # perform string concatenation of string 
      
      # take the input from user 
      
      
      .2 then Create a Class,using the CLASS being named players giving them a 
      name and there pick of (rock, paper or scissors) class will be under controls.

      .3 next step would be making the game file and giving it the function to take in the players and there pick .
      by importing them .



# import random module ›
# Print multiline instruction 
# perform string concatenation of string 
# take the input from user 
# OR is the short-circuit operator 
# if any one of the condition is true 
# then it return True value 
# looping until user enter invalid input 
# initialize value of choice_name variable 
# corresponding to the choice value 
# print user choice  
# Computer chooses randomly any number  
# among 1 , 2 and 3. Using computer method 
# of random module         
# is equal to the choice value 
# initialize value of comp_choice_name
# variable corresponding to the choice value 
# condition for winning
